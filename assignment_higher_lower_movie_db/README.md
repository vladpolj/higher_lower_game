## To build a project
* Java 1.17 or newer
* Gradle 7.5 or newer

## About default setup
* `gradle assemble` to initialize a project
* You can start Spring application via your favourite ide or using `gradle bootjar` and then executing previously created jar
* It uses h2 for db so no need to setup any external database. To access running application db http://localhost:8080/h2-console/login.jsp (login parameters are in application.properties file)
* schema.sql will generate sql tables when Spring application starts
* If you have any problems to run this pre-setup Spring application then feel free to create your own Spring project

## Assignment
  * Build a simple game of higher or lower using given movie database. For example http://www.higherlowergame.com/

  * Game rules:
	* Player can choose which category they want to play with (vote average, popularity, run time, revenue)
	* Player is given 2 different movies with chosen category value revealed
	* Player has to choose if the value on the 2nd movie is higher or lower than the chosen category of the 1st one
	* If the player chose correctly, the game continues, the 2nd movie will replace the first one, and a new movie is loaded for comparison
	* Game ends when the player makes an incorrect guess
	* Movies with same category values shouldn't be matched together

  * Resources:
	* For the task h2 database with table movie is given. Table contains data about 4798 movies.
	* Table columns are original_title, overview, popularity, release_date, revenue, runtime, tagline, title, vote_average, vote_count 

  * Main tasks:
	* Build a Java console application using Java 1.8 or newer (we recommend using Java 17) which allows to play a game of "higher or lower"
	* Build a normal game mode with the rules from above
	* Build a hard game mode where at least every second round is between 2 movies that are closely ranked. For example if previous movies was with vote_average 7.9 then 2nd movie should be between values 7.7 and 8.1.
	* Player can choose between different game modes after each game
	* Remember the current highest score achieved for both game modes 
	* At least title should be given for every movie, but feel free to add also additional info like (overview, tagline, original title, release date, tagline)
	* Feel free to add any more functionalities you think would be cool to add

  * For additional credit:
	* Instead of console application, build a simple UI for the game, using your preferred framework (We prefer Angular, but feel free to use any Javascript framework you like)
	
  * Our expectations:
	* Your code is available on GitHub or any other VCS
	* Your code is clean and logically structured
	* Game logic is separated from other functionalities
	* Your code has tests where necessary
	* You are ready to explain your game & code
	* You are aware of the possible bugs in your game & code
